# Universal deterministic patterns in stochastic count data

This repository contains the Julia code and generated plots for the paper [1], where the corresponding data are deposited at [dd](dd)

**Requirements:**

- Julia v1.9.4
- CSV v0.10.12
- Plots v1.39.0
- StaticArrays v1.9.2
- StatsBase v0.34.

All the codes have been tested on a MacBook Pro with Apple M3 Pro chip (11 cores) and 18 GB RAM.

All the curves are computed using the equation
$$
\langle n\rangle =\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\text{FF}+\sqrt{\frac{8k+n_c(1-\text{FF})^2}{n_c}}\right),
$$
of which the details are described in [1].

**File description:**

- `fig_plot.jl` is the main code for data processing and generating figures.
- `FigS1.svg` and `Fig4.svg` are the results generated by the code `fig_plot.jl` and presented in [1].
